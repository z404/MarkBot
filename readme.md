## Structure of the bot

V1 has been discarded as it is extremely uncomfortable to work with and develop. V2's structure will be defined here.

As is visible, the driver code for the bot exists in [bot.py](MARKBOT/MarkBot-v2/bot.py). Each file in the cogs folder contains a command cog. Each of these cogs have a bunch of commands that have the same theme. If a new set of commands were to be developed, they would be made in a new cog.
