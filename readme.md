## Structure of the bot

V1 has been discarded as it is extremely uncomfortable to work with and develop. V2's structure will be defined here.

- ðŸ“„ [runscript.sh](runscript.sh)

As is visible, the driver code for the bot exists in [bot.py](MARKBOT/MarkBot-v2/bot.py). Each file in the cogs folder contains a command cog. Each of these cogs have a bunch of commands that have the same theme. If a new set of commands were to be developed, they would be made in a new cog.

## How to set up the bot on your local machine

! Under construction :(

## Make your own command for Mark

Open an issue! I'll be glad to help out! You can add me on discord as well (Wilford Warfstache#0256)

## Difficulties when making the bot

- Discord is changing continuously. Adapting to these changes is definitely not easy
- As of April of 2022, In-chat commands will no longer work. Only slash commands will work
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), the library being used to code this bot has been marked read-only and will not be developed further
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) has no support for slash commands, and any other library in python that implements slash commands does not have support for voice channels (No music slash commands)
- The new library being used for slash commands, [Discord-interactions](https://github.com/goverfl0w/discord-interactions) is a little low on documentation
